# Tip Calculator

### Description
In the US, it's customary to leave a tip for waiting staff like bartenders and waiters. An accepted range for the tip, also known as gratuity, is between 15% to 20% of your total bill (but I usually leave 20% or more). Instead of having to do the math in your head, I've built a simple tip calculator to calculate the tip for you.

*A tip calculating app built to further learning on core concepts of UI components, UIKit objects, auto-layout & stack view, & configuring UI objects programmatically*

### Technologies:
- Swift
- UIKit
